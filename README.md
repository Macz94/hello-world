# hello-world
This is my first repository just for checking out Github. 

It's my first day on github.. 

I want to learn how to code.. 

Unfortunately i dont have any experience with coding, but i hope, that i will learn it in the future. 

For now, i am thinking about, what coding language i should learn.
